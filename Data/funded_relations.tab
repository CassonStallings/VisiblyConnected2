Black and the founding board members set an agenda that allocated grants for schools, hospitals, and human service organizations reaching out to the disadvantaged in the Baltimore community and the region. In the past three decades, the Foundation has sharpened its focus to address complex challenges to break through the cycles of urban poverty. Today, the Foundation places the highest priority on creating solutions that are both innovative and will ensure accountability. This is the commitment of The Abell Foundation: to give hope by opening the doors of opportunity to the disenfranchised, knowing that no community can succeed and thrive if those who live on the margins are not included. We invite you to use this website to visit our Publications/Research section where you&#8217;ll find thought-provoking perspectives on issues affecting the community at large.     The Abell Foundation places a priority on supporting efforts that enhance the quality of life in the areas of community development, education, health and human services, criminal justice and addictions, workforce development and to a lesser extent, conservation/environment, and arts and culture. The Foundation is among the largest private foundations in Maryland with assets of more than $314 million.

Black and the founding board members set an agenda that allocated grants for schools, hospitals, and human service organizations reaching out to the disadvantaged in the Baltimore community and the region. In the past three decades, the Foundation has sharpened its focus to address complex challenges to break through the cycles of urban poverty. Today, the Foundation places the highest priority on creating solutions that are both innovative and will ensure accountability. This is the commitment of The Abell Foundation: to give hope by opening the doors of opportunity to the disenfranchised, knowing that no community can succeed and thrive if those who live on the margins are not included.
